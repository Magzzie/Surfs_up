# Surfs_up
Weather analysis of the island of Oahu to plan for a Surf n' Shake shop.<br>
Using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask.

## Project Background
This analysis project focuses on studying the weather in the islands of Hawaii to construct a business plan for a Surf n' Shake store. <br>
The Surf n' Shake shop will be serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists of the islands. <br>

While personal savings are available to invest in the business, having some actual investor baking would provide a solid base for the success and longevity of the project as well as enabling a quicker initiation of the plan. <br>

W. Avy is a surfing enthusiast and businessman with access to substantial funds and can recruit his company's interest in investing in this shop if we can provide him with a sound analysis favoring sales sustainability regardless of seasonal weather changes. <br>

We plan to focus our efforts on the beautiful island of Oahu and study its weather trends concerning rain and temperature over the past few years, plus a direct comparison between midsummer and midwinter temperatures. <br>

We will provide the results in multiple graphs with a user-friendly URL for more detailed insight into the actual data. <br>

## Objectives
1. Analysis of the last 12 months of precipitation data from the island of Oahu, reflected in a plot of precipitation scores in chronological order. 
2. Determining the number of weather stations and the level of activity of each station. 
3. Identifying the most active weather station on the island to suggest the best location for the shop. 
4. Trend analysis of temperatures over a year based on data from Oahu's most active weather station. 
5. Analysis of temperature trends for the months of June on the island.
6. Analysis of temperature trends for the months of December on the island. 
7. Creating a Flask application to share the findings via a URL.
